            <h2>Locations of schools and the ways students move around Victoria</h2>
            <p class="intro">
                This visualisation explores how primary and secondary students across Victoria travel to school.
                Using official Victorian Government datasets, we examine where schools are located, how many exist
                in each Local Government Area (LGA), and how various modes of travel appear to assist different 
                students in getting to school.

                    <p class="text-block">
                    This choropleth map shows the number of schools in each Victorian LGA in 2025. It is 
                    expected that there would be a higher concentration of schools in the suburbun regions 
                    towards the city in comparison to outer regions of Victoria. However, there is a notable 
                    amount of schools in rural areas like Mildura or East Gippsland which can indicate a 
                    higher migration of families with students towards particular rural areas over the years.

                        Among many types, Victoria’s school system mainly includes primary schools. While it is no 
                        surprise that there are a larger number of Primary and Secondary schools all together, this might
                        help shine some light on the importance of having more special or other schools so that the state 
                        continues to progress in inclusitivity as well as accessibility.

                        The preferred mode of travel for both Primary and Secondary school students 
                        appears to be travelling as a vehicle passenger. However, more Primary school
                        students than Secondary school students travel this way while there are a vastly 
                        greater number of Secondary school students who take the train indicating a 
                        greater independance in travelling for older Victorian students.

                    <p class="text-block">
                        In comparing the average travel time and distance for each mode, students who walk 
                        to school reach school faster travelling a shorter distance while students who take 
                        the train or school travel further and longer. Between the two main school levels, 
                        Secondary school students generally tend to travel longer and further to school than 
                        Primary school students which can indicate many factoring reasons like age and level 
                        of indepenance, including the much greater number of Primary schools in Victoria.
